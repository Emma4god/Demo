<p>The name September comes from the Latin septem, meaning seven, since it was the seventh month of the Roman calendar, which began with March. There are 30 days in the month of September, which starts on the same day of the week as December each year but does not end on the same day of the week as any other month in the year.</p>
<p>As the ninth month of the year, September marks the beginning of autumn in the northern hemisphere (and the start of spring in the southern). Traditionally considered the month that marks transitions between seasons, it is often one of the most temperate weather-wise.

That dye the flowers of September!
